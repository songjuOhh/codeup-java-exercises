    * Mini-exercise:
    * Investigate the substring method for String objects in the Java API.
    * Find out what kind of exception it throws. Create a test class with a main method.
    * Set up a try-catch block that defines a string and finds its length.
    * Once you have the length of your string, modify your program so it creates a substring from your original string,
    * but give it an index that doesn't exist so you get the error message.
